# vue-dnd-character-sheet-app

A small web app to help with the creation and maintenance of a character for a game of [Dungeons & Dragons.][1]

What I would like to achieve with this app is for it to that support offline mode, 
 multiple characters and theming.

## Trying for the first time ðŸ¤ž
* [Vue][2]
* Offline mode
* Light/Dark mode with support for high contrast
* Testing with [Jest][3]

This app is going to be bit of a playground for me, so it could be interesting to see what happens.
